# repeat2016 starter kit
This repo contains a VS 2015 solution with two projects in it.
The first Project has a signalr hub started.
The second project has a console test client that can be used to test the hub methods.
You will need to build the project when you download it as the nuget packages are ignored in the git ignore file.
The signalr hub works off http://localhost:15250/.
Please fork your own copy off this repo and continue as your own
